Convert Version 1.10
---------------------
Converts uppercase file names to lower case and visa versa.


Syntax
--------
The program command-line is as follows: 

  convert -u/l <filename>

 -u = convert to uppercase (I wrote it to convert both ways)
 -l = convert to lowercase
 <filename> = a filename including wildcards like * and ?      

Story
--------
I wrote this small application to convert files from uppercase to lowercase after doing a project with a couple of friends who where using Windows 95.

Everytime they saved files onto thier disks, the filenames were in uppercase, which made it hard to port onto my OS/2 system and the UNIX system which the project was being designed for.


History
--------
1.1  Fix temperary environment bug.  Also simplified the code.
- Convert does not work on FAT drives only on HPFS.

1.0  I thought it was such a simple program, there should not be any bugs.
